He suggested that I take a look at web and software development, as he is currently working a full time developer. Not only that, it didn't necessarily matter that I received a Computer Science degree or not. Instead, I could take the time to learn and apply my skills as well as demonstrate that I know how to effectively do the job in order to get hired. After much thought and research, I made the decision to make this my career path.",
            "p3": "After a few lessons on Free Code Camp and Treehouse, I started making my own projects and attending local meetups to learn from experienced developers. Along the way, I ran into multiple obstacles in my learning, but my new support network encouraged me to keep pushing forward. With each line of code I wrote, I gained more and more confidence in my work and knowledge of web development and created several static sites. Soon, my friends told me it was time to apply to jobs!",
            "p4": "Finally, after applying for 70 jobs across the country, I finally got a job as a full time developer in Baltimore, MD! I am very thankful for all of the hard work I put in as well as the encouragement I received from my friends along this journey. The best part is I have come to realize that I have become a lifelong learner, gaining knowledge of new technologies and utilizing them in my new projects. In addition, I hope to inspire others to achieve their goals of becoming a developer as well since I attribute much of my success to the people who mentored me while I was learning code."
